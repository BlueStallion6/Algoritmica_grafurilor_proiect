# Sample Graph File Format

# First line: n m d w
# n = number of vertices
# m = number of edges
# d = directed (0 for undirected, 1 for directed)
# w = weighted (0 for unweighted, 1 for weighted)

# Remaining lines: u v [w]
# u, v = vertices (edge from u to v)
# w = weight (optional, only if weighted)
